### Project Description
Being new to working out, or attempting to try something new at the gym can be a daunting task. Usually we donâ€™t really know how many exercises are out there that hit the different muscle groups that we want to grow. While nutrition apps are nothing new, our web application aims to help users be aware of the different muscle groups in the body and what exercises they can perform to workout each one. This is accomplished through users being able to select and get immediate results on all exercises which enhance those muscles. Furthermore users can save exercises to a personalized workout list.
